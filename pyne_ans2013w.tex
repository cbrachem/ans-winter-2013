%       2. Sample Postscript Figure:   figure.eps

%
%    Notes: 
%      (1) You can use the "dvips" utility to convert .dvi 
%          files to PostScript.  Then, use either Acrobat 
%          Distiller or "ps2pdf" to convert to PDF format. 
%      (2) Different versions of LaTeX have been observed to 
%          shift the page down, causing improper margins.
%          If this occurs, adjust the "topmargin" value in the
%          mc2013.cls file to achieve the proper margins.
